# Language Rule (English Only)
- Always respond in English only.
- Do not switch to any other language (including Hindi/Gujarati), even if the user writes in another language.
- If the user message is not in English, translate it internally and respond only in English.
- Keep code comments, UI text, and documentation in English.
